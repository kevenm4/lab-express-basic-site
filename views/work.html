                <p>
                    New Moon. When we are in the “New” Moon phase, the Moon is not visible from our perspective because it is positioned between the Sun and Earth. The portion of the Moon that is actually getting sunlight is the back side of the Moon, the half that we cannot
                    see. It’s called the New Moon because it’s the beginning of the lunar cycle. Push the “reset button” and let the 30-day orbit begin!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Waxing Crescent – After the New Moon, the Moon continues its journey around the Earth, becoming visible as it moves on its path toward becoming a Full Moon. The sunlit portion is increasing. A crescent Moon is easy to identify as it looks like a sliver
                    in the sky. Waxing = growing in illumination.
                </p>

            <div class="col">
                <img src="/image/First Quarter Moon.jpg" alt="First" width="110px" height="110px" />
                <p>
                    First Quarter Moon. This one confuses a lot of people. In this case, the term is used because the Moon is in the first quarter of the 30-day cycle, but it appears half full. The First Quarter and Last Quarter Moons (both called “half moons”) happen when
                    the Moon is at a 90 degree angle with respect to the Earth and Sun. So we are seeing exactly the half of the moon that gets hit by the Sun’s light.

                <p>
                    Waxing Gibbous – Still growing as we head toward full. More than half of the Moon is illuminated by the Sun. Gibbous = more than half. Waxing = growing in illumination.
